CompSci 308: SLogo Addition
===

# Before

### Estimation

 * How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
 I think it will take about an hour to implement these features.
 

 * How many files will you need to add or update? Why?
I will need to add two command classes, Stamp and ClearStamp. In addition, I will need to update the 
properties file and backend manager to include an API to clear and add turtles. Then I will
also have to implement a function that keep track of which turtles are stamps and which are not.
During the Stamp method, the turtle manager should generate a turtle image and keep track that
it is only a stamp. During the clear method, all of these stamps should be deleted.


# After

### Review

 * How long did it take you to complete this new feature?

 * How many files did you need to add or update? Why?

 * Did you get it completely right on the first try? If not, why not?


### Analysis

 * What do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation --- was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?

 * What about the design or documentation could be improved?

 * What would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?
